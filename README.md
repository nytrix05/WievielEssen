This was just a quick assignment i finished for the Minihackathon. Unfortenetly there is no feature where you can scan the barcode, but at least you are able to search your product. 
The API i used is from "openfoodfacts".

If you want to test the application
Just install "python3.12"
"pip install kivy"
